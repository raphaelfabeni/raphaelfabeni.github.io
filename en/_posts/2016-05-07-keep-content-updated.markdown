A user, in most cases, access a website for a **objective**: searching the last numbers of lottery, print some medical results or even ask something to eat. It's your (or ours) objective to think in the best way/experience in how the user will do that.

Talking more, not about of how the experience will be projected but about in what maybe would be the focus of the *whole thing*: the information or content that user looks for. Something that in most cases is abandoned and which only has due attention when the problems starts to appear.

In a world of digital projects not so distant, what happens frequently is related to *it's not my responsibility*. So, a website area needs to finalize the content and:

* area X says it's not responsibility of it and that is part of area Y work.
* however, the area Y says that does not make sense they take care of it and that could be demand of area Z.
* the area Z says that it's not with them, but they could help. However they are really busy and it could take some time..
 
So we can predict the outcome of this *seesaw*: content came out worse than the current Brazilian soccer team.

## A real case: the reward

I only stay motivated to write briefly about it because it happened with me recently the problem of *content out of date*. I had some points in my credit card and I needed to chance for some benefit as I would cancel my credit cards. So, I made a simple research (because I did not have so much points), and made a **choice**: I changed something mine, for a **reward**.

The idea of *reward* is a important thing, because I, as a user, felt excited in could *earning* something, even if it is from a change of points.

The reward was nothing more than some credits that I could use in some establishments. The company has a website with some informations about the *program*, amongst them a map that showed the address of the establishments. So, I got some addresses from places near of my house and guess what? Two of them **did not know** about the program and one **did not even exist**.

I made contact with the company and they said that they were taking the necessary actions and they apologize for the troubles. I told them that all that mess was an absurd but that I believe that a had a bad luck and I could try again in another region. So I did it and guess what? The establishments wall all closed with wood plates (probably a new construction).

Seems like a joke right? But it's not. What I thought about all of it is that something which **experience would be great** because I was using a *benefit/reward*, became totally the oposite. I, as user, as soon as use my benefit (I hope soon), I intend to never come back to use the services of the company.

Do you like it? Did I write something stupid? Do you want to improve? Open an [issue](https://github.com/raphaelfabeni/raphaelfabeni.github.io/issues) mentioning the post and let's talk about it.
