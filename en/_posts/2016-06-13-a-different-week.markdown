Almost two years that I and [Felipe Fialho](https://twitter.com/lfeh) organize the [Meetup CSS](https://github.com/raphaelfabeni/css-sp); it was also around this time that I got courage and sent my first talk proposal.

Luckily, the proposal was accepted and [my first talk](http://www.thedevelopersconference.com.br/tdc/2014/saopaulo/trilha-front-end) was in the same week of the [first edition of CSS meetup](http://www.thedevelopersconference.com.br/tdc/2014/saopaulo/trilha-front-end). Since this week, I started to have more interest in the comunity and conferences; I also try to go to every meetup and conference that I can, as a listener or speaker, and not only in São Paulo but in other states too.

After some time, I could list some things as:

* Wake up early in a saturday and stay all day long in a conference.
* Spend money in tickets and flights/fuel/hotel (for conferences in other states).
* Organize a for free meetup and some times need to spend money on it.

And yet, I see much more positive points.

## A front-end and UX week

Talking about conferences, let's go to it: if you like or want to start to go in one, the last week of june will be a diferent week from the others. In a same week will happen [Front UX](http://frontux.com/), [Meetup CSS](https://github.com/raphaelfabeni/css-sp), [Code in the Dark](http://codeinthedark.com.br/) and [Front in Sampa](http://frontinsampa.com.br/). 

**Saturday - 25/06**

* *Sampa JS*
* The only conference focused only on JavaScript in São Paulo city. It was the first event that I went and certainly one of the best cost-benefit ratio talking about conferences.

As far I know, maybe we will have something here!  **:)**
