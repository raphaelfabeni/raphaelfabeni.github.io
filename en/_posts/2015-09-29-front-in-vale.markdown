Last weekend ocurrend in São José dos Campos, the [Front in Vale](http://www.frontinvale.com.br) conference which is the first event from *Vale do Paraíba* focused in front-end and I was there talking about Development Culture.

## About the event

In my opinion the event was great. I arrived there around 8:30 AM *really* hungry because afraid of being late, I did not take breakfast in São Paulo. So, I asked for a near bakery and I was surprised by the coffee break. **\o/** A good point about the event is that parking of the hotel that was hosting the event was free; something that is almost impossible to happen in São Paulo.

There were no delays between the talks; and a good point about it is the good location of the hotel: there was a shopping mall in front of the event where the people could go have lunch.

## The talks

### Talking about Development Culture

The theme borned in a [FEMUG](https://sp.femug.com/), a [talk](https://speakerdeck.com/raphaelfabeni/falando-sobre-cultura-de-desenvolvimento) edition and the [talk](https://speakerdeck.com/raphaelfabeni/falando-sobre-cultura-de-desenvolvimento) is about some concepts related to the theme and some items applied on Netshoes day by day.

### Throttle & Debounce Patterns in Web Apps

In my opinion this [talk](https://speakerdeck.com/almirfilho/throttle-and-debounce-patterns-in-web-apps) is one of the best that I've ever seen of [Almir Filho](https://twitter.com/almirfilho). He showed two very cool concepts that could help us to solve some perfomance problems.
