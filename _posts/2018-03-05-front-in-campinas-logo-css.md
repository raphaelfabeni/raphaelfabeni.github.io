These last days I saw a tweet talking about [Front in Campinas](https://frontincampinas.com.br/). The conference has everything to be amazing, and I'm strongly thinking of sending a talk proposal.

So, I accessed the website, and then I saw the logo. The first thing I thought: "Could I do this one using only CSS? And maybe, only one. `div`? I've already challenged myself on [Front in Floripa logo](front-in-floripa-logo-css/).

So I started, and guess what? The first trial was not so successful. When I realized the drawing's complexity, I had to delete everything, and it starts from scratch.

It took about 1 hour to finish everything but I could do it. I think if I didn't want to use only one div, probably I would do it faster. And for sure, there is way to do it without using `:before` and `:after` but my CSS knowledge is not so good yet.
