I'm not a React expert but I've worked with the framework in the past and I have to say that [classnames](https://github.com/JedWatson/classnames) is something that helps you a lot.

Code is better than words. So, I used to do something like this

or...

{% gist 5c26a6fb658f04d229a97e26acc894e8 %}

It works... but thinking about the possibility of the number of CSS classes start to increase, this approach wouldn't be good enough. So, I found out this magic called _classnames_.
