If there is something that I like a lot in web applications, no matter what is the type of the project, it is UI interactions. The cool thing here is to show the user what is happening in the interface, not only as a simple animation but also as something functional.

When you work focused on the front-end, it's not hard to happen, and I already did this a lot, rewrite the same code or one that is similar a couple of times. And for me, the simpler the code is, the more significant my desire to have something ready-to-use.

With this concept in mind, plus my passion for CSS, I decided to create the [UI interactions](https://raphaelfabeni.com/ui-interactions) project some time ago. The idea was to be something quick and straightforward. Something simple as _copy and use it_. I need to say that it's been a while that I don't work on the project, but soon I want to add some new interactions.

I hope this could help you! :)
