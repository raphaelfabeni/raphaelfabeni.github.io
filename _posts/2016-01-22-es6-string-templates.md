Play with *strings* can often be something a little bit painful (you can also read boring *இ_இ*). This is due mainly to the fact of having to concatenate words/phrases with variables.

My friend [Rafael Rinaldi](https://twitter.com/rafaelrinaldi) made a good point: you can use any kind of expression, not just variables.
