Some time ago, I presented a talk at FrontinSampa about CSS tips, and one of the topics was about a check animation that I tried to do using only CSS.

I tried in different ways, and it's funny because when you're developing and animating in CSS, you need to think like CSS; even doing that be something really strange.

The first thing was to draw the check: the basic idea was to create a rectangle w/ borders and remove two of them, making them like a letter L. After that, we only use the `rotate` and we have the check.

So, now it's the fun part: how to make the animation? The first thing that I thought of was how to animate the borders? So, after a while, I realized that I should think differently. Basically, I've drawn a rectangle, so I had to animate the shape: `width` and `height`.

The animation is simple and only animates these two properties plus the `opacity` to make it cooler. To finish, we just change the `origin` of `transform` to let the check centralized during the animation.
