In most cases, a user accesses a website for an **objective**: searching the last numbers of the lottery, print some medical results, or even ask something to eat. Your (or ours) objective is to think in the best way/experience in how the user will do that.

Talking more, not about how the experience will be projected but about what maybe would be the focus of the _whole thing_: the information or content that the user looks for. In most cases, something that is abandoned and only has due attention when the problems start to appear.

In a world of digital projects not so distant, what happens frequently is related to _I am not usually the one that handles it_. So, a website area needs to finalize the content and:

* area X says it's not the responsibility of it, which is part of area Y's work.
* However, area Y says that it does not make sense they take care of it, which could be area Z demand.
* The area Z says that it's not with them, but they could help. However, they are swamped, and it could take some time...

So we can predict the outcome of this _seesaw_: content came out worse than the current Brazilian soccer team.

## A real case: the reward

I only stay motivated to write briefly about it because it recently happened to me the problem of _content out of date_. I had some credit card points, and I needed to chance for some benefit as I would cancel my credit cards. So, I did simple research (because I did not have so many points) and made a **choice**: I changed something small, but it was a **reward**.

The idea of a _reward_ is an important thing because for me, as a user, I was excited to earn something.

The reward was nothing more than some credits that I could use in some establishments. The company has a website with some information about the _program_, a map that showed the establishments' address. So, I got some addresses from places near my house, and guess what? Two of them **did not know** about the program, and one **did not even exist**.

I contacted the company and said that they were taking the necessary actions and apologizing for the troubles. I told them that all that mess was absurd but that I believe that it a bit of bad luck and I could try again in another region. So I did it, and guess what? The establishments wall all closed with wood plates (probably a new construction).

It seems like a joke, right? But it's not. I thought about all of it because something which **would be great** because I was using a _benefit/reward_ became the opposite totally. As soon as I use my benefit (I hope soon), I intend never to come back to use the services of the company.
