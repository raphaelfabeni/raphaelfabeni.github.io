CSS3 was already something really cool. In version 4, or better saying, in _level 4_, as it will be divided from now, CSS has many more features. One of them is the `:matches` selector.

Using it, we could substitute something like that:

{% gist a7b5fc0e8c7d2f5edb983b791adef64d %}

For that:

{% gist eb85105186b637f39141eb60db5d6593 %}

In other words, we get every `highlight` class that are children of a `div` or `footer`.

We could even make the inverse way, as in the example below: we select all `p` elements that have the `success` class or that is `first-child`.

{% gist 5d1e3a873bec33562147be84f0eab917 %}
