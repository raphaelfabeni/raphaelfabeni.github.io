Something that usually I stay thinking for a while is: "how to draw that only using CSS"? I know, I'm crazy!

These last days I saw a post about [Front in Floripa](http://frontinfloripa.com.br/) and when I accessed the website I looked some minutes for the event's logo and I thought: maybe with CSS we can draw it.

<figure class="text-center loading">
	<iframe height='389' scrolling='no' title='Front in Floripa CSS logo' src='//codepen.io/raphaelfabeni/embed/Jrerxb/?height=389&theme-id=dark&default-tab=result&embed-version=2' frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true' style='width: 100%;'>See the Pen <a href='https://codepen.io/raphaelfabeni/pen/Jrerxb/'>Front in Floripa CSS logo</a> by Raphael Fabeni (<a href='https://codepen.io/raphaelfabeni'>@raphaelfabeni</a>) on <a href='https://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</iframe>
</figure>

I have this craziness to test if some UI components could be build using only CSS. Some time ago I wrote about a [simple check animation](/simple-check-animation/). For me, all these new CSS features made easier to draw but in my opinion, the hardest part is to connect all those things to draw part per part of what you want.
