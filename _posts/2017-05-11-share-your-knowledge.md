I always like to write: I was responsible for this part at school and college projects**,** and I was totally cool with that. When I decided to write on the internet, my initial idea was to choose a subject, not only technical, and try to write and learn more about it.

Commonly, you see some people that want to start to write something, but they don't do it or because the person is shy, or because they think they don't have enough topics to keep writing or, finally, because they think they are going to write about basic things, and they are worried about what people could think about it.

## It's time to change!

One simple tip: **change your thought**! Simple like that! Some reasons to motivate you to start writing:

* learn and fix existing content.
* learn something new.
* document some solution, project, or idea that you had, and that could help other people.
* a lot of others.

## Share!

Some time ago, during an edition of FEMUG, I heard a really nice story about a guy that works abroad, and he was in a conference talking with some people about a bug that he faced in a project, and after some tentatives, he was able to fix it. Right after that, he said that a person asked him: "And where did you document it?" And the silence remained.

I have a simple and sincere opinion about this. And I even talked about it with a friend who had created a blog some time ago: he wrote an initial post but didn't write anything more because he was worried about what people would think.

I think **you have to write for yourself**, to document something that you did or studied, practice a new language (as I'm trying to do), or just because you want to write. You do that; you _share your knowledge_ and could help other people who will access your post in the near future.

There isn't a fool or simple subject, as many people say. What is simple for you **could be the solution to a lot of people**.
